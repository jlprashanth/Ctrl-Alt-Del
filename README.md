Water Contamination Using K means Clustering


# K Means Clustering:
This Program uses a dataset of the levels of Water Contamination levels in a particular city, with the attributes of Chlorine levels,temperature and water flow.

4 clusters are formed from them, and are grouped based on the levels of water contamination in the city.

# Neural Network
This programs is used to test the training set ( which are of Binary values), which uses the sigmod function to predict the exact Contamination level

When values near [0.99391605] are mostly contaminated and lesser the values the lesser contamination

The dataset contains
             Climate   Chlorine Temperature  Waterflow
                
                [0,        0,        0,        1],
                [0,        0,        1,        1],
                [0,        1,        0,        1],
                [0,        1,        1,        1],
                [1,        0,        0,        1],
                [1,        0,        1,        1],
                [1,        1,        0,        1],
                [1,        1,        1,        1]
